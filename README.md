# Trebel-transfer

This project will aim to programmatically transfer all my songs from Spotify to Trebel because I got annoyed by Spotify's increasing ad interruptions, bugs, and randomly playing Kpop as a suggested song when there is nothign remotely resembling KPop in any of my playlists.
Starting with a CSV generated by spotmybackup, it will use adb to add songs using touch input events and Trebel's GUI.
